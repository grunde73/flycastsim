=======================

`blitziot` is a Python library, and a set of command line scripts/programs
for streaming, handling and analysing IoT data.

Package structure
---------------------
The package structure follows "the typical" `setuptool` structure, with the following
(main) files and folders:



.. code-block:: txt
    FIXME: add output from tree command


 
Test driven development
--------------------------
Please make sure any new functionality added to the package is tested
using `pytest`. All test code and data should be located in the
`./tests/` folder in the package root folder.

For more information on using and running ``pytest`` see `pytest documentation <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html>`_
or a random `tutorial <https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/testing-python-applications-with-pytest>`_
or this `tutorial <https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/>`_ .
